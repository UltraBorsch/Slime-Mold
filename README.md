# TODO
* Camera controls (zoom, pan, etc).
* Species count > 4.
* Bypass thread creation limit (update compute helper).
* Move agent creation/spawning to a compute shader.

# Known Issues
* Might have a bug the first time I load scriptable objects, where some are not loaded with the correct information.
* Might have an issue where things don't load in on save+run.
