# TODO
* camera controls (zoom, pan, etc).
* species > 4.
* bypass thread creation limit (update compute helper).
* make compute helper more data-type agnostic, i.e. instead of having 6 overloading methods change it to one.
* move agent creation/spawning to a compute shader.

# Known Issues
* might have a bug the first time i load scriptable objects?
